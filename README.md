<h2>Description</h2>
In finalizing the incident handler's journal, I ensured comprehensive documentation of the security incident, adhering to the requirements by completing four journal entries. In two entries, dated and detailed investigations were conducted, addressing the 5 W's: identifying the perpetrator, describing the incident's nature, recording the timestamp, specifying the location, and investigating the root cause. Additionally, two entries outlined the utilization of cybersecurity tools, providing insights into their role in incident analysis and resolution. This meticulous record-keeping underscores the significance of capturing key details to support effective incident management and response actions.
